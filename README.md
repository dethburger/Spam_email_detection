Description:

E-mail spam detection: A cost sensitive approach of
Deep Learning Models


In the digital age, email has become an essential
communication tool, both for personal and professional interactions. However, its widespread use has also made email a main
target for unwanted and often harmful spam messages, which not
only fill inboxes with unnecessary emails but also pose security
risks, including phishing attacks and the spread of malware.
Detecting and filtering out spam emails is thus crucial to maintain
the effectiveness of email communication and protect users from
potential harm.
In this research, we tackle the challenge of spam email detection by exploring and comparing the performance of various
machine learning models, including a Feed-Forward Neural
Network (FFNN), cost-sensitive Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN), cost-sensitive Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and a
cost-sensitive Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. Our
thorough experiments on a dataset comprising both spam and
ham (non-spam) emails show that all models achieve impressive
accuracy in distinguishing between spam and ham emails. Notably, the cost-sensitive LSTM model outperforms the others with
an exceptional accuracy of 98.38%, demonstrating its superior
ability to understand and use the sequence of text data for spam
detection. These findings highlight the effectiveness of LSTM
networks in spam email detection and offer valuable insights for
developing more robust and reliable spam filtering systems.
